Since I was very young, I have always been passionate about innovation and technology, my interest in science and knowing how everything works has always been very great and this made me dismantle all my toys, simply to understand and feel the pleasure of creating something new with the pieces.

When I was 14 years old, I was able to fulfill my dream of studying electronics in a course given by volunteers from a church of oriental origin that my mother attended. In the course I was able to learn electricity and what each electronic component and AM radio are for. At the end of the course I was able to make a printed circuit board in a project that had a ci 4017 that turned on LEDs sequentially, generating me a lot of satisfaction.

Only when I turned 16, I got my first computer as a gift, which I wanted so much, I bought a lot of computer magazines, since all this was always very interesting to me. I wanted to learn to program c/c++, visual basic, delphi, html that was so much talked about at the time and installed compilers and created simple programs.

In the year 2000 I was approved for the former Cefet (current IFF), to attend technical high school and I was able to enjoy the library and the microdome with internet, where I found several books on programming languages ​​and could delve a little more into the subject than ever before. I got interested.

In 2004 I graduated in telecommunications and started working in companies as an electronics and telecommunications technician, coming to excel in the repair and installation of telephony equipment.

At the end of 2014 I decided to go back to studying programming, only this time for Android studying java in the Eclipse ide. In a short time I managed to create a simple application to advertise stores in the city, a gallery with only 27 positions, it was possible through a web-service, to include and change store data.

With this success, I was motivated to create several applications and publish them, including a delivery platform, which has a separate management app, with an agile kanban methodology for delivery, its own chat and the most interesting, a product registration language, which can read a pdf, for example, and register all the products in this file, without having to type anything.
